### Setting up User Secrets

To securely store sensitive information such as connection strings, you can use the `dotnet user-secrets` tool. Follow the steps below to set up user secrets for the project:

1. Navigate to the backend project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../Contoso.Api
    ```

2. Initialize user secrets for the project:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    ```

3. Set the connection string as a user secret:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:ContosoDBConnection" "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING_FOR_SQL_SERVER"
    ```

By using user secrets, you ensure that sensitive information is not hard-coded in your source code and is kept secure.
